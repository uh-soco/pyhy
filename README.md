from py4hy import people

matti = people.search('Matti Nelimarkka')

print( "Call Matti", matti['mobileNumber'] )
print( "Matti works at", matti['organizations'][-1]['name'] )

csds_org_id = matti['organizations'][-1]['id']
csds = people.by_organisation( csds_org_id  )

for member in csds:
  print('Also working at CSCS:', member['firstnames'] + ' ' + member['lastname'])
```
